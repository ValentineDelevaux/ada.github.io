                            Ah, now we move on to something truly fascinating—the evolution of gender in horror films, 
                            and how it compares to the broader film industry.
                            Notice the general trend? <strong>While men have been the dominant figure in both genres, horror 
                                seems to have an interesting shift. </strong> In the earlier years, the proportion of women 
                                in horror films was rather low. But as we approach the modern age, there is a slight increase
                                 in female representation, though it still pales in comparison to men.
                            <strong>But here’s the dark twist: notice how the gap between men and women in horror films seems
                                 to widen significantly after the 1960s—particularly in the 1990s. It was as if the horror genre 
                                 became more and more dominated by male-centric stories, with women relegated to victim roles 
                                 or secondary characters. </strong> The 2000s onwards seem to show a slight shift, but still...
                                  one must wonder, are we truly seeing the full potential of female horror icons?
                            <strong>Perhaps this is why Dracula has always preferred the company of strong, fierce women—he
                                understands the power they hold, even if the rest of the world hasn’t caught on quite as 
                                quickly. </strong>

                        <p> Ah, dear visitor, we now step into a quieter, yet no less revealing part of the mansion—<strong>where 
                            we examine the profiles of the first actors in movies, focusing on their gender and ethnicity as shaped 
                            by the ominous keywords in the titles. </strong> Prepare yourself, for even in this reflection, society’s
                             shadows are laid bare.

                    <div class="col-md-12 textdiv33">
                        <p> First off, let us look at the intriguing profiles of the first actors of movies with —<strong>PREY and 
                            PREDATOR</strong> in their titles. Look closely, and you will see curious patterns emerge. <strong>Men, 
                                as ever, are associated far more with the word predator, a staggering 72%—a reflection, perhaps, 
                                of how dominance and menace are intertwined with masculinity in our shared imagination. Women, by 
                                contrast, find themselves tied to the word prey, their share rising to 58%, hinting at a lingering 
                                fascination with vulnerability and peril. </strong>
                            And what of the world beyond gender? Here we uncover another stark imbalance. —<strong>North 
                                America</strong>, ever the dominant force in cinema, claims the lion’s share of these titles, 
                                while <strong>Europe</strong> steps forward as a secondary stage. The rest of the world—<strong>Asia,
                                     the Middle East, and Latin America</strong>—remains eerily absent, their stories left lingering
                                      in the shadows, untold and unseen.
                            These patterns are not just mere chance, dear guest, but <strong>a reflection of how horror and its 
                                language are shaped by society’s gaze</strong>. The actors who step into their light are pulled
                                 into a narrative far older than the silver screen itself. <strong>But who knows? Perhaps one day 
                                    the shadows will shift, and new voices will rise to challenge the roles that we so often take
                                     for granted. Wouldn’t that be a tale worthy of the great Count Dracula himself? </strong>

                        <p> <strong>In this corner of the mansion, we delve into the shadows cast by aliens, ghosts, 
                            vampires, witches, and zombies</strong>—not the creatures themselves, mind you, but the
                             actors whose presence brings these titles to life.
                            First, behold the gender divide. <strong>Men seem to dominate the association with titles 
                                like ghosts (66%), vampires (61%), and, most prominently, zombies (76%). It is as if 
                                horror’s lens frames the male presence as the monstrous or unnatural force lurking in 
                                the dark. The women, however, claim a far larger share of titles involving witches (71%),
                                 a figure steeped in history and myth—a role that ties femininity to power, fear, and 
                                 the arcane. Curiously, women also appear in notable proportions under ghosts (34%) and 
                                 aliens (47%), hinting at their presence in roles both haunting and otherworldly, yet
                                  rarely dominant. </strong>
                            And now, dear guest, we shift our focus to ethnicity—a map of absence as much as presence.
                            <strong> North Americans lead this dark parade, almost across all keywords</strong> —whether 
                            it be aliens (65%), ghosts (39%), or zombies (69%). <strong>Europe</strong> follows closely
                             behind, particularly in titles tied to witches (50%) and vampires (45%), <strong>suggesting 
                                a lingering connection to folklore and gothic tradition. </strong> But beyond these realms,
                                 the shadows grow still. <strong>African, Asian, Middle Eastern, and Latino/Hispanic actors
                                     remain largely unseen, their presence faint or nonexistent—an eerie silence where diverse 
                                     tales could have flourished.</strong> A small glimmer appears with Asian actors and ghosts
                                      (34%), a nod, perhaps, to the influence of Asian horror’s spectral legacy.
