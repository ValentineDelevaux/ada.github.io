                    <p> Please excuse this abrupt... end to the visit, dear visitor. It seems that Dracula, 
                        perhaps already tired from his current movie-making, was really not in the mood to 
                        welcome people into his mansion! Oh, he told me I was not supposed to let anyone in 
                        on Sundays... I guess losing my head is a fair price for my mistake!

                    <p> I hope you learned a lot during this tour, and don't hesitate to come back in a few decades 
                        to see the evolution of horror movies from today! My master's new masterpiece, <strong>Dracula and 
                        the Eight-Headed Shark</strong>, will surely be the best movie of the century, and a new room dedicated
                         to this masterpiece may appear!
                        Have a good day, dear visitor.
