                <p> Now we are in the hall of all fears, an other beautiful piece of my master's collection.
                    Dracula uses this room to study how to scare people. As you may imagine, this evolves over the years, the public...

                <p> Have a look at this. Can you imagine ? 44.1% of the horror movies in Dracula's collection 
                    contain someone that dies! How sad... But not for my master, as he... well he is dead, in a sense. 
                    Still, for humans, <strong>death is concerning and seems to have a special role in horror.</strong>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-12 texttriggers2">
                <p> And if we look at kids, well 36.6% of the horror movies have a kid that dies!! Oh, even my master
                    would not like that.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-12 texttriggers3">
                <p> Oh this is interesting. Do you know jump scares? It's when something appear suddenly on the screen!
                    A very popular way to scare people, it seems. I remember myself, when I was still alive, bitting my 
                    tong a few times because of them!

            <div class="col-md-12 texttriggers4">
                <p> When you think about ghost movies... Do you picture the famous scene of exorcism? Well, interestingly,
                    religion is not so much present in horror movies! Maybe because <strong>religion is almost ONLY called for ghost stories.</strong>
                </p>

            <div class="col-md-12 texttriggers5">
                <p> Look at this one now. 43.1% of the horror movies contain torture!? Why would people look at that?
                    Your species is so interesting for us.

            <div class="col-md-12 texttriggers6">
                <p> Let's finish with this. Sad endings. Have you ever wonder why people go to the cinema? Do they want to 
                    escape for 1h from their life? Their problems? Or are they looking for adrenaline? Almost half of the horror movies
                    have a sad ending. How do people feel after watching something with a bad end?

                <p> Now we can compare the content between horror movies and other genres. How fascinating. It seems that 
                    horror movies contain a lot more deaths than others! Kids or not! And look at the third one! Ohh Jump scares
                    seems to be a very specific characteristic of horror movies! They are not so used in others.

                <p> Here is an interesting point. Do you remember that we said religion was not so present in horror movies? Well 
                    it is even worse in other genres! So even if religion is not discussed in all horror movies, this genre is still
                    more focus on believes than others. It is also interesting to note that torture and sad endings are also more often 
                    presented in this so peculiar genre.
